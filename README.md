# An App related to Tech for Better
[Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/techforbetter/) is a pro-bono programme for nonprofits to design, test and build new digital service ideas using developers in London and Gaza.

## About the client 
My Pickle is a nonprofit social enterprise platform that helps people find support. In doing so, funds are raised to help more people access the services they need & support VCS services.

Over the course of three workshops related to the Tech for Better Programme (TfB), Cat (MyPickle 5 Founder and Product Owner) presented her ideas and goals. Catâ€™s basic aim was to create a platform related to Integrated Wellness. Integrated wellness addresses multiple health & wellbeing factors rather than a single issue. It is an holistic, person-centred approach and uses a combination of services, to bring together services, activities & technologies across all eight dimensions of wellness. For example, mental health support, debt advice & healthy lifestyle services.

TfB supported the concept and helped designing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focussing on the most relevant features and needs presented by the product owner.

## About the MVP
The appâ€™s ambition is to create a proof-of-concept enabling the product owner to test the idea to create an Integrated Wellness Platform. The responsive web-app can be seen as a connector for people that are offering support and individuals looking for support. Support providers go through a sign-up process relating themselves to one or more dimensions of integrated wellness. An additional profile builder allows them to input further details such as support offerings, booking & availability and target clients. Secure authentication was managed to be set up on top of the initial planned scope meaning that each support provider can have their own unique log in, with all their data protected.

Another main feature of the app is that registered support providers can create blog posts related to their fields of expertise. This should allow users to find out more about specific topics and offer advice. Blog posts as well as profiles are related to various data categories with the aim to eventually provide filter options enabling users to find information and support in an effective manner. Moreover a very basic CMS system was embedded. Before profile listings go live they have to be approved by the product owner. 

As stated above what has been built to date is a MVP that will enable the product owner to do further user testing.

## Workflow summary
December 10th-14th
Meet and greet between the London and Gaza teams, discussing personal project goals, setting up user manuals, final client workshop in London including Gaza-team via Google hangouts, design-phase (initial wireframing, prototyping), user testing, agreeing on preferred tech-stack.

December 17th-21st
Core-sprint: set up project environment, create basic features (e.g. sign up process, authentication, profile builder, profile editor, blog) 

January 7th-11th
Core+-sprint: debugging, design features, image-upload, filter, cms-system

## Team
My Pickle was the second application built within the TfB graduate program which can be seen as an ongoing effort to establish long-term relations between developers from London and Gaza in order to work on client projects in an agile way.

## Summary
The remote working process went well and we gained valuable insights. We used those experiences and are currently designing guidelines in terms of remote working process and project management for our upcoming project and especially for future grads. The communication between the developers and the product owner was good. The final product included all core features and a high number of core+ features. The product handover went smoothly and the Product Owner was really pleased with the MVP. 

## Getting Started
How to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

*Please ensure you have this software **installed and running** on your local machine **before** you attempt to run this webapp.*
> **Node** (via nvm recomended)
> see: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

> **MongoDB**
> see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

### Setup

#### 1. Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/techforbetter/myPickle.git
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies 
```
$ npm run both:init
```

#### 3. Get Mongo running on your local computer
Connect to mongo in a separate terminal tab/window.
```
$ mongod
```

#### 4. Add some more Environment Variables
Create a `config.env` file in the root.

Add theseðŸ‘‡ lines to the file, to make your local databases work, inserting your own psql username and password.
```
mongoURI= mongodb://localhost:27017/mypickledb
mongoURI_TEST= mongodb://localhost:27017/mypickledb_TEST
```
Add a 'Secret' for password encryption.
```
SECRET = "[SOMETHING SECRET]"
```

#### 5. Build the Database
Use this script that runs dummy_data_build.js to set up your survey questions and put in some inital dummy data
```
$ npm run build:dummyData
```

#### 6. Run the Tests
To make sure everything is working as it should.

```
$ npm run test:both
```

#### 7. Run the Server
```
$ npm run dev:both
```
Wait for a `compiled successfully` message.

#### 9. Have Fun
The webapp should now be running on
```localhost:3000```
Now you can play with the code all you like ðŸŽ‰

If you notice anything wrong with the instructions or the project isn't running as expected don't hesitate to raise an issue and we'll try to figure it out.
